            When European settlers arrived in Alabama there were 3 tribes living in Alabama, the Chickasaw to the northeast, the Cherokee in the northwest, the Creek People occupying the most land in the center and southeast, and Choctaw in the southwest. First people to arrive in Alabama were the Spanish searching for gold and slaughtering the Choctaw,  they eventually left when they found no gold. In 1702 French settlers established a permanent settlement in Alabama called "Mobile" keeping the British out. In 1763 the French lost Mobile in a treaty giving it up to the british. After this the british lost Mobile in the American Revolution giving Mobile to the Spanish and the rest to the new U.S.A. Then the U.S.A. claimed Mobile in the Louisiana Purchase. Later on the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw ceded (gave up) their land to the US. 1814 Andrew Jackson defeat the Creek People, then in 1832 they finally left the territory.

            Alabama started out as the Mississippi territory in 1798, then it split into it's own territory in 1817 becoming a state in 1819. As Alabama grew so did the population consisting of white farmers and enslaved blacks, making the economy revolve around cotton picking. Some attempts to industrialize where made during this time with railroads, cotton manufacturing, and mining. Ultimately these attempts failed because lack of funding, so Alabama stayed reliant on cotton and free labour.

            In 1861 alabama left the USA and joined the CSA, establishing its capital in Montgomery the present day Capital of Alabama. The state soon started drafting soldiers and giving money to support the families of those drafted soldiers Around 29% (35,000) of the 122,000 soldiers who served in the civil war died. After the civil war Alabama refused to ratify the 14th amendment forcing the US to put alabama under Martial Law, until the state finally ratified the amendment.

            After the events of civil war Alabama was very unstable, many White Alabama citizens saw this period as tragic while blacks saw this as a period of hope. Much of this period was filled with a struggle from blacks and whites. Many white people wanted to be superior even the Huntsville Advocate saying  “This is a white man's government and a white man's state,” (Charles Goode Gomillion, https://www.britannica.com/place/Alabama-state/The-Civil-War-and-its-aftermath). The situation worsened as the KKK used terror to enforce this view. The black citizens of Alabama earned some victories, getting education but still being segregated. The situation soon got even worse as white Alabama democrats took over the state giving black people no power, until the 1960s. In between this time some people did work under the shadows to move some political activity and enlighten the white community.

            Slowly after 1880 Alabama started to industrialize manufacturing cotton and pig iron. Alabama's economy still relied mostly on cotton, but in 1915 the boll weevil blight damaged the crop economy so much that the state had no choice but to diversify its economy. During this time the black population started to decline as they migrated to more free states. Soon when the Great Depression hit the price of cotton fell so much that the economy halted to a standstill. Some of the problems were taken care of by federal aid and new economic activity. When World War 2 came around the state ended the economic depression by industrializing finally completing in 1940s and 50s.

            Up until the 1950s racial segregation was still a problem in Alabama. In 1954 the supreme court ruled segregation as unconstitutional but still progress in Alabama was slow. Soon protests and boycotts started showing up around the state making Martin Luther King, Jr. rise in Alabama. The protest were filled with violence as fire hoses, and police dogs were used on the protesters. Some attempts were made to stop the movements but failed nevertheless. In 1964 and 1965 bills were passed ending segregation and making near impossible for it to start again. In later years black participation in Alabama's politics started to expand slowly but surely.
