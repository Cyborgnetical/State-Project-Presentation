                <p class="info-card">
                    Alabama first entered the united states as the Mississippi territory in 1798, as a small sliver of
                    land.
                    In 1804 the U.S. annexed some land, expanding the Mississippi territory northward by a lot.
                    In 1812 again the U.S. annexed more land giving a small bottom bit to the Mississippi territory and
                    access to the ocean.

                <h2 class="info-card">The Split<br>1817</h2>
                <p class="info-card">
                    In 1817 the Mississippi territory split in half, the west becoming the State of Mississippi and the
                    right into the Alabama territory.
                    The reason the Mississippi was split into two was because white southerners wanted to see 2 slave
                    states.
                    In 1819 under president James Monroe, alabama became an official state with William Wyatt as its
                    first governor

            <p>Alabama used to be a cotton and slave reliant state. Even after the civil war there were segregation problems until the civil rights protests.</p>
            <p>Alabama is now a very industrialized state with some amazing things that I was amazed by.</p>
            <p>It's great to start a business in Alabama due to its general environment for businesses </p>
            <p>They also have a great aerospace part or sector (whatever you want to call it) with the first aviation school being founded here and Marshall Flight Center (NASA)</p>
